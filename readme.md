#USTPT 
===

USTPT is a data visualization of teen pregnacy trends in the United States, using a PSQL database, Node, D3.js, and some jQuery. This information comes from a report published by the [Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/us-teen-pregnancy-trends-2011). There was not an exsisting API, for the report, so I decided to create one. 


The project is currently deployed on heroku, <https://ustpt.herokuapp.com/>
